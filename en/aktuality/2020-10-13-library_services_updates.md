Our library had to be closed due to preventive measures following the
restrictions given by the Government of the Czech Republic until further
notice. We prolonged loans until November 18, 2020. All [e-resources](catalogues.html)Â are
available 24 hours a day. Books can be returned in the Bibliobox next to the
reception desk. You can also mail them back to us. You can pay any [late fees by bank transfer](fees.html).

Feel free to use our online
advisory via FB
[@knihovnapedfpraha](https://www.facebook.com/knihovnapedfpraha)! We can help
you with access to a wide array
of electronic content, bibliographic references management, and lookup of literature.
